# FSI_Hackathon
### A project for the FSI Hackathon
Phoenix team came up with a solution of a short unique key that contains all
the banking information of an individual, making it easier to select a user's bank of 
choice and make transfer without entering an account number using our 
USSD code
Over time USSD transactions have been the safest and most reliable method of transferring money from one account to another. 
It's non-reliance on internet connection has made it more accepted thereby giving it an edge over other forms
of electronic funds transfer. 
But then comes the issues of entering a 10-digit account number and selecting a bank
from a list that contains all the banks in Nigeria.
This prompted Phoenix team to come up with a solution of a short unique key that contains all 
the banking information of an individual, making it easier to select a user's bank and make 
transfers without entering an account number. 
All the user does is to use our USSD service and enter the unique key of the recipient which will display the 
various bank accounts owned by that individual. The user then selects a particular bank without having to
enter an account number or search through tonnes of banks.
